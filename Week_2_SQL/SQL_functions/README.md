There are two types of SQL functions, aggregate functions, and scalar(non-aggregate) functions. Aggregate functions operate on many records and produce a summary, works with GROUP BY whereas non-aggregate functions operate on each record independently.

There are so many built-in functions in SQL to do various calculations on data.

SQL Aggregate Function	This function can produce a single value for an entire group or table. They operate on sets of rows and return results based on groups of rows.
Some Aggregate functions are -

SQL Count function
SQL Sum function
SQL Avg function
SQL Max function
SQL Min function

SQL Arithmetic Function	A mathematical function executes a mathematical operation usually based on input values that are provided as arguments, and return a numeric value as the result of the operation. Mathematical functions operate on numeric data such as decimal, integer, float, real, smallint, and tinyint.
Some Arithmetic functions are -

abs()
ceil()
floor()
exp()
ln()
mod()
power()
sqrt()

SQL Character Function	A character or string function is a function which takes one or more characters or numbers as parameters and returns a character value. Basic string functions offer a number of capabilities and return a string value as a result set.
Some Character functions are -

lower()
upper()
trim()
translate()
