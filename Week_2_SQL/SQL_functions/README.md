## There are two types of SQL functions, aggregate functions, and scalar(non-aggregate) functions. 

#### Aggregate functions 
- Operate on many records and produce a summary, works with GROUP BY whereas non-aggregate functions operate on each record independently.
- This function can produce a single value for an entire group or table. They operate on sets of rows and return results based on groups of rows.
####  Some Aggregate functions
```
SQL Count function
SQL Sum function
SQL Avg function
SQL Max function
SQL Min function
```
### SQL Arithmetic Function	
```
A mathematical function executes a mathematical operation usually based on input values that are provided as arguments, and return a numeric value as the result of the operation. Mathematical functions operate on numeric data such as decimal, integer, float, real, smallint, and tinyint.
```
#### Some Arithmetic function
```
abs()
ceil()
floor()
exp()
ln()
mod()
power()
sqrt()
```
#### SQL Character Function
``` 
A character or string function is a function which takes one or more characters or numbers as parameters and returns a character value.
```
