# SaaS, PaaS, IaaS


## SaaS - Software as a Service
```
SaaS also known as cloud application services, represents the most commonly utilised option for businesses in the cloud market. 
It utilises the internet to deliver aplications which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users. 
A majority of SaaS run directly through your web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.
As its delivered via web, SaaS eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install applications on each PC. 
Vendors manage all potential technical issues, such as data, middleware, servers and storage resulting in streamlined maintenance and support for the business.
```
### Used by:
```
- Startups or small companies that need to launch e-commerce quickly and dont have time for server or software issues.
- Short term projects that require quick and easy collaboration.
- Applications that aren't needed too often, such as tax software.
- Applications that need both web and mobile access.
```
### Advantages
```
- Greatly reduces the time and money spent on tedious tasks such as installing, managing and upgrading software.
- As a result frees up plenty of time for technical staff to spend on more pressing matters within the organisation.
```
### Disadvantages
```
- Interoperability - Issues with integration with existing apps and services.
- Vendor lock-in - Vendors may make it easy to join a service and difficult to get out of it.
```

## PaaS - Platform as a Service
```
PaaS also known as cloud platform services provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. 
PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to 
1- develop, 
2- run, 
3- and manage 
applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.
PaaS is delivered similarly to SaaS except of delivering the sofrware over the internet, PaaS provides a platform for software creation. 
The platform is delivered via the web giving developers the freedom to concentrate on building the software without having to worry about OS, software updates, storage or infrastructure.
PaaS allows businesses to design and create applications that are built into the PaaS with special componenets. 
The applications sometimes are called middleware are scalable and highly available.
```
### Advantages
```
- Simple, cost-effective development and deployment of apps
- Scalable
- Highly Available
- Developers can customise apps without maintaining software
- REDUCTION OF CODING
- Automation of business policy
```
### Disadvantages
```
- Data Security - data resides with third-party cloud servers, poses risk
```
### Integrations
```
Examples
Windows Azure
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Google App Engine
```


## IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
```
AKA cloud infrastructure services are made of highly scalable and automated compute resources.
IaaS is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, netwowrking, storage and other. 
IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as needed instead of having to buy hardware outright.
Delivers cloud computing infrastructure, including servers, network, OS, storage through virtualisation tech. 
These cloud servers are typically provided to the organisation through a dashboard or an API giving IaaS clients complete control over the entire infrastructure. 
Iaas provides the same tech and capabilities as a traditional data center without having to physically maintain or manage all of it. 
Clients can still access the servers and storage directly, but it is all outsources through a 'virtual data center' in the cloud.
As opposed to SaaS or PaaS, IaaS clients are responsible for managing aspects such as applications, runtime, OSes, middleware and data. 
HOWEVER, providers of the IaaS manage servers, hard drives, networkgin, virtualisation and storage.
```
### MANY Advantages
```
- Resources are available as a service
- Cost varies depending on consumption
- Services are highly scalable
- Multiple users on a single piece of hardware
- Organisation retain complete control of the infrastructure
- Dynamic and flexible
- Disadvantages
- Security - Host and virtual machines can still be attacked.
- Internal resources and training - money needs to be spent on people who know how to manage the infrastructure
- Multi-tenant security required
- Examples
- DigitalOcean
- AWS
- Cisco Metacloud
```
### Localhost
```
On premises or localhost refers to the idea of using software/computing services on site, more specifically:
1. Localhost refers to the machine the developer is using. 
Example. 
- You work on code on your localhost, and then in order to have it stored on the cloud, you push it to services like GitHub via Bash or other terminal means.
```
### Hybrid cloud
```
Solution that combines a private cloud with one or more public cloud services, with proprietary software enabling communication between each distinct service. 
A hybrid cloud strategy provides businesses with greater flexibility by moving workloads between cloud solutions as needs and costs fluctuate.
```
### Public Cloud
```
Public Cloud services provide storage and networking services on demand to many organisations (and the general public) over the internet. 
They may be free or offered on a usage-based pricing model. 
- These are operated and managed by cloud service providers such as:
1. AWS
2. Microsoft Azure
2. Google Cloud Platform
```
