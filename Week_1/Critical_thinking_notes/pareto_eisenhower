## Pareto principle. Pareto Rule or the 80/20 Rule.

- The Pareto Principle, named after esteemed economist Vilfredo Pareto, specifies that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs.

- The relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced.
- The Pareto Principle is an observation that things in life are not always distributed evenly.

- The Pareto Principle can be applied in a wide range of areas such as manufacturing, management, and human resources. For instance, the efforts of 20% of a corporation's staff could drive 80% of the firm's profits. The Pareto Principle can be applied especially those businesses that are client-service based. It has been adopted by a variety of coaching and customer relationship management (CRM) software programs.

Time management is the most common use for the Pareto Principle, as most people tend to thinly spread out their time instead of focusing on the most important tasks. In terms of personal time management, 80% of your work-related output could come from only 20% of your time at work.

### What Is Pareto Analysis?
```
Pareto Analysis uses the Pareto Principle – also known as the "80/20 Rule" – which was coined by Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto, in his 1896 book, "Cours d'économie politique."
The Pareto Principle states that 80 percent of a project's benefit comes from 20 percent of the work. Or, conversely, that 80 percent of problems can be traced back to 20 percent of causes. Pareto Analysis identifies the problem areas or tasks that will have the biggest payoff. The tool has several benefits, including:
Identifying and prioritizing problems and tasks.
Helping people to organize their workloads more effectively.
Improving productivity.
Improving profitability.

### Pareto Analysis Steps
```
Now, we'll take a look at how to carry out a Pareto Analysis:
1. Identify and List Problems
Write out a list of all of the problems that you need to resolve. Where possible, gather feedback from clients and team members. This could take the form of customer surveys, formal complaints, or helpdesk logs, for example.
2. Identify the Root Cause of Each Problem
Next, get to the root cause of each problem. Techniques such as the 5 Whys   , Cause and Effect Analysis   , and Root Cause Analysis   are useful tools for this.
3. Score Problems
Now, score each problem that you've listed by importance. The scoring method that you use will depend on the sort of problem that you're trying to resolve.
For example, if you want to improve profits, you could score problems by how much they cost. Or, if you're trying to improve customer satisfaction, you might score them based on the number of complaints that you've received about each.
4. Group Problems Together
Use the root cause analysis that you carried out in Step 3 to group problems together by common cause. For example, if three of your problems are caused by lack of staff, you could put these into the same group.
5. Add up Scores for Each Group
Now, add up the scores for each group that you've identified. The one with the top score should be your highest priority, and the group with the lowest score your lowest priority.
6. Take Action
Finally, it's time to take action! Your highest scoring problem will likely have the biggest payoff once fixed, so start brainstorming   ideas on how to solve this one first.
You may find that your lowest-scoring problems aren't worth bothering about, particularly if they are very costly to fix. Use your Pareto Analysis to save your energy and resources for what's important!

## Eisenhower principle
```
- In a 1954 speech to the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches, former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was quoting Dr J. Roscoe Miller, president of Northwestern University, said: "I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent." 
- This "Eisenhower Principle" is said to be how he organized his workload and priorities.
He recognized that great time management means being effective as well as efficient. In other words, we must spend our time on things that are important and not just the ones that are urgent. To do this, and to minimize the stress of having too many tight deadlines, we need to understand this distinction:
- Important activities have an outcome that leads to us achieving our goals, whether these are professional or personal.
- Urgent activities demand immediate attention, and are usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. They are often the ones we concentrate on and they demand attention because the consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.
- When we know which activities are important and which are urgent, we can overcome the natural tendency to focus on unimportant urgent activities, so that we can clear enough time to do what's essential for our success. This is the way we move from "firefighting" into a position where we can grow our businesses and our careers.
