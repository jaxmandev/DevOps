## Python:
#### Interpreted:
- It can execute at runtime, and changes in a program are instantly perceptible. 
- To be very technical, Python has a compiler. 
- The difference when compared to Java or C++ is how transparent and automatic it is. 
- With Python, we don't have to worry about the compilation step as it's done in real-time. 
- The tradeoff is that interpreted languages are usually slower than compiled ones.

#### Semantically Dynamic:
- You don't have to specify types for variables and there is nothing that makes you do it.
#### Object-Oriented:
- Everything in Python is an object. But you can choose to write code in an object-oriented, procedural, or even functional way.
#### High level: 
- You don't have to deal with low-level machine details.
#### Dynamic typing:
- Which means you don't have to tell it if your variable is a text or a number, for instance.

### Popular

#### System scripting:
- It's a great tool to automate everyday repetitive tasks.

#### Data Analysis: it is a great language to experiment with and has tons of libraries and tools to handle data
- Create models, visualise results and even deploy solutions. This is used in areas like Finance, E-commerce, and Research.

#### Web Development: 
- Frameworks like Django and Flask allow the development of web applications, API's, and websites.

#### Machine Learning: 
- Tensorflow and Pytorch are some of the libraries that allow scientists and the industry,
- to develop and deploy Artificial Intelligence solutions in 
1. Image Recognition, 
2. Health, 
3. Self-driving cars, and many other fields.
