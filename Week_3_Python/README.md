## Python:
```
1. Interpreted: it can execute at runtime, and changes in a program are instantly perceptible. 
To be very technical, Python has a compiler. 
The difference when compared to Java or C++ is how transparent and automatic it is. 
With Python, we don't have to worry about the compilation step as it's done in real-time. The tradeoff is that interpreted languages are usually slower than compiled ones.
2. Semantically Dynamic: you don't have to specify types for variables and there is nothing that makes you do it.
3. Object-Oriented: everything in Python is an object. But you can choose to write code in an object-oriented, procedural, or even functional way.
4. High level: you don't have to deal with low-level machine details.
5. Dynamic typing, which means you don't have to tell it if your variable is a text or a number, for instance.

```
1. System scripting: it's a great tool to automate everyday repetitive tasks.
2. Data Analysis: it is a great language to experiment with and has tons of libraries and tools to handle data, create models, visualise results and even deploy solutions. This is used in areas like Finance, E-commerce, and Research.
3. Web Development: frameworks like Django and Flask allow the development of web applications, API's, and websites.
4. Machine Learning: Tensorflow and Pytorch are some of the libraries that allow scientists and the industry to develop and deploy Artificial Intelligence solutions in Image Recognition, Health, Self-driving cars, and many other fields.
